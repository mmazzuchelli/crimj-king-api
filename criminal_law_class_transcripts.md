`Reckless Killings` `Depraved Indifference` `Misdemeanor Manslaughter`

## Theme

This lecture explores various aspects of criminal law, focusing on reckless killings, depraved indifference murder, and misdemeanor manslaughter. It analyzes several cases to illustrate these concepts, including the Koslow case of involuntary manslaughter, the Knoller case involving a fatal dog attack, and discussions on indictment procedures. The lecture emphasizes the legal definitions, evidence considerations, and the complexities of proving culpability in cases where death results from reckless or negligent behavior.

## Takeaways

 1. The chapter discusses five cases involving reckless killings and forms of recklessness

 2. Recklessness can be as culpable as intent in some circumstances

 3. None of the defendants in these cases intended to kill someone

 4. Donna Koslow was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for leaving her baby in a hot car

 5. Koslow's appeal argued insufficient evidence of recklessness

 6. The court found Koslow's explanation not credible based on evidence

 7. A problem case involved a father convicted of first-degree murder for leaving his child in a car

 8. The Knoller case involved charges of second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter for a dog attack

 9. California law recognizes two types of malice: express and implied

10. The Knoller case received significant media attention and a change of venue

## Highlights

- `"Recklessness, this is the involuntary manslaughter that we talked about."-- Prof Rehnquist`

- `"The law sometimes says that it's too bad, because recklessness can be as culpable in some circumstances as intent, but the law does have to recognize the difference."-- Prof Rehnquist`

- `"Those are the two big arguments in a criminal law course, insufficient evidence and an improper jury instruction, okay?"-- Prof Rehnquist`

- `"Depraved indifference, the court defines depraved indifference as utter disregard for the value of human life."-- Prof Rehnquist`

- `"A willingness to act, not because one intends harm. But because one... simply doesn't care whether grievous harm results or not."-- Prof Rehnquist`

- `"An indictment is the criminal version of a complaint. It's the document that sets forth the charges."-- Prof Rehnquist`

- `"Misdemeanor manslaughter is defined as an unintentional homicide committed while performing another criminal act that is not a felony."-- Prof Rehnquist`

- `"Remember, when there is an appeal from a conviction, the appeals court looks at the evidence with what angle? In the light most favorable to the state."-- Prof Rehnquist`

## Chapters & Topics

### Reckless Killings in Criminal Law

> Reckless killings are a form of involuntary manslaughter where the defendant does not intend to kill someone but acts with reckless disregard for human life. The law recognizes that recklessness can be as culpable as intent in some circumstances.

- **Keypoints**

  - Recklessness is a form of mens rea in criminal law

  - Reckless killings are typically charged as involuntary manslaughter

  - Defendants in reckless killing cases do not intend to cause death

  - The law may treat recklessness as seriously as intent in some cases

- **Explanation**

  In criminal law, recklessness is a state of mind where a person consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that their actions may cause harm or death. While not as severe as intentional acts, reckless behavior can still result in serious criminal charges, particularly when it leads to a death. The law recognizes that such disregard for human life can be highly culpable, even if the person did not specifically intend to cause harm.

- **Examples**

  > Donna Koslow was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for leaving her three-month-old baby in a hot car while she went inside to sleep. The baby died as a result. Koslow appealed her conviction, arguing insufficient evidence of recklessness.

  - The court considered Koslow's actions leading up to leaving the baby in the car, including her activities the night before

  - Evidence suggested Koslow consciously chose not to bring the baby inside due to concerns about her stepmother's reaction

  - The appeals court found that a reasonable jury could have found Koslow's explanation not credible

  - The court rejected Koslow's argument that as a new mother she was unaware of the risks

  - Koslow's sentence included probation, counseling, and six months in custody, reflecting multiple theories of punishment including deterrence, retribution, and rehabilitation

  > Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel were charged in connection with the death of a woman mauled by their dogs. Knoller was charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter, while Noel was charged with involuntary manslaughter.

  - The case involved the concept of implied malice in California law, defined as "killing with an abandoned and malignant heart"

  - The court presented extensive evidence of the defendants' knowledge of the dogs' dangerousness and their disregard for safety warnings

  - The defendants' attitudes and reactions to previous incidents were considered relevant to the charges

  - The case received significant media attention, resulting in a rare change of venue for the trial

  - The court's opinion painted a vivid and unfavorable picture of the defendants' conduct and character

- **Considerations**

- The specific definition of recklessness may vary by jurisdiction

- Courts may consider a wide range of evidence to establish recklessness, including prior behavior and attitudes

- The line between recklessness and negligence can be subtle and may depend on the specific facts of the case

- Media attention and public opinion can potentially influence criminal proceedings in high-profile cases

- **Special Circumstances**

- If encountering a case where the defendant claims ignorance of risks, how should it be addressed in light of societal expectations and common knowledge?

- If dealing with a case involving significant media attention, how should concerns about prejudice and fair trial rights be balanced?

### Depraved Indifference Murder

> Depraved indifference murder is a legal concept where the defendant shows a complete disregard for human life, acting in a way that demonstrates they don't care if their actions result in death, even if they don't specifically intend to kill.

- **Keypoints**

  - Defined as utter disregard for the value of human life

  - Involves willingness to act without caring about grievous harm

  - Differs from recklessness in its level of disregard for consequences

  - Does not require intent to harm or kill

  - Can allow for broader range of evidence to be presented in court

- **Explanation**

  The concept of depraved indifference murder is explored in the context of the Snyder case. The professor discusses how this charge differs from recklessness and how it allows for a wider range of evidence to be presented, including the defendant's overall behavior and attitude. The case demonstrates how actions that show a complete disregard for life, even without direct intent to kill, can be prosecuted under this charge.

- **Examples**

  > In this case, a mother was charged with depraved indifference murder for allegedly suffocating her children to continue receiving Social Security benefits. The prosecution presented evidence of her behavior in the hospital, financial motivations, and apparent lack of concern for her children's well-being.

  - Evidence included testimony from a mobile home salesman about the family's financial dependence on the children's benefits

  - Medical personnel testified about the mother being the only witness to the children's breathing problems

  - An autopsy report indicated death consistent with suffocation

  - A fellow inmate testified about Snyder's alleged confession

  - The mother's conduct on the day of the baby's death was presented as evidence of depravity

- **Considerations**

- The distinction between recklessness and depraved indifference can be subtle and may require careful consideration of the defendant's state of mind and actions

- Evidence of a defendant's overall behavior and attitude, not just the specific act in question, can be relevant in proving depraved indifference

- Financial motives or other personal gains can be factors in establishing depraved indifference

- **Special Circumstances**

- If encountering a case where the defendant claims they didn't intend harm, how should the prosecution approach proving depraved indifference?

- If dealing with a situation where multiple parties are involved in a potentially depraved act, how should individual culpability be assessed?

### Indictment in Criminal Procedure

> An indictment is a formal accusation document that officially charges a person with a criminal offense. It is one of the most common ways for a criminal case to begin and is analogous to a complaint in civil procedure.

- **Keypoints**

  - Indictment sets forth the charges against the accused

  - Standard of proof for an indictment is probable cause

  - Indictments are much harder to dismiss than civil complaints

  - Indictments typically only need to list the elements of the crime

- **Explanation**

  The indictment process involves a grand jury finding probable cause, which is a lower burden of proof compared to the standard required for conviction. Unlike civil complaints that may be dismissed under the Twombly and Iqbal standards, indictments are very difficult to dismiss because they only need to outline the basic elements of the alleged crime.

- **Examples**

  > In the case discussed, the defendant Bichelle was indicted for 100 counts of misdemeanor manslaughter related to a fire incident. The indictment was based on the possession and control of pyrotechnics without a proper permit.

  - The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, which was denied in the trial court

  - The appeal focused on whether the charged conduct constituted a crime under the statute

  - Arguments for dismissal included that the conduct wasn't covered by the statute, lack of fair warning, and issues with mens rea

- **Considerations**

- Ensure that all elements of the crime are included in the indictment

- Consider the difficulty of dismissing an indictment compared to a civil complaint

- Be aware of the lower standard of proof (probable cause) required for an indictment

- **Special Circumstances**

- If encountering a case where the indictment seems vague, how should it be addressed? Carefully review the elements of the crime listed and compare them to the statute, as dismissal will likely require showing that the charged conduct does not constitute a crime under the law.

### Misdemeanor Manslaughter

> Misdemeanor manslaughter is a legal concept where an unintentional homicide occurs during the commission of a criminal act that is not a felony. It combines elements of a lesser crime (misdemeanor) with an unintended death.

- **Keypoints**

  - Defined as unintentional homicide during a non-felony criminal act

  - Requires proving the underlying misdemeanor violation

  - Proximate cause is a key element in establishing liability

  - Mens rea (mental state) requirements can be complex

- **Explanation**

  In misdemeanor manslaughter cases, the prosecution must prove that the defendant committed a misdemeanor offense and that this offense was the proximate cause of someone's death. The court in the discussed case interpreted that the requirement of proximate cause imports a concept of foreseeability, which can satisfy the mens rea requirement for a criminal violation.

- **Examples**

  > Jesse Carrillo was charged with involuntary manslaughter and distribution of heroin after supplying heroin to Sina Cori, who subsequently died from an overdose. Carrillo was convicted at trial and appealed based on insufficient evidence.

  - The case involved charges of involuntary manslaughter and heroin distribution

  - Evidence showed Carrillo supplied heroin to Sina Cori on multiple occasions

  - The appeal focused on whether there was sufficient evidence to support the involuntary manslaughter conviction

  - The court had to consider the definition of involuntary manslaughter under Massachusetts law

- **Considerations**

- Evaluate the nature of the underlying misdemeanor and its relation to the death

- Consider the foreseeability of harm resulting from the misdemeanor act

- Assess the proximity between the misdemeanor act and the resulting death

- **Special Circumstances**

- If encountering a case where the death seems distantly related to the misdemeanor, how should it be addressed? Carefully analyze the chain of causation and whether intervening factors might break the causal link between the misdemeanor and the death.

- If encountering a drug distribution case resulting in death, how should the presence or absence of fentanyl be considered? The presence of fentanyl, even if unknown to the distributor, could significantly impact the case due to its high potency and associated risks.

## Assignments & Suggestions

- Study the concept of recklessness in criminal law and be prepared to apply it to factual scenarios on the exam

- Listen to the podcast "American Scandal" for more information about the fire incident discussed in the lecture.

## Explanations

### 1. Involuntary Manslaughter in the Carrillo Case

- **Key Points**

  - The legal standard for involuntary manslaughter in Massachusetts is wanton or reckless conduct, defined as a high likelihood of substantial harm to another.

  - The court decided that selling heroin alone does not meet the standard for wanton or reckless conduct.

  - The court required "more" than just the sale of heroin to establish involuntary manslaughter.

- **Explanation** 

  The court examined the statistics of heroin use disorder and fatal overdoses, concluding that selling heroin alone does not create a high likelihood of substantial harm. They rejected the prosecutor's arguments about withdrawal symptoms and an unanswered text message as insufficient evidence of recklessness. The court also looked at precedents from other jurisdictions, which typically require the sale of drugs plus additional factors to establish involuntary manslaughter.

- **Statistical Analysis of Heroin Use and Overdose Deaths** 

  > In 2017, there were 650,000 people in America with heroin use disorder. Out of these, 15,000 fatal overdoses occurred, which is about 2% of the total. 

  1. The court used this statistic to argue that selling heroin does not create a "high likelihood" of substantial harm, as required by the legal standard for involuntary manslaughter.

- **Prosecutor's Arguments for Recklessness** 

  > The prosecutor argued that two factors should have alerted Carrillo to the victim's risk: a text message about "veins crying" and an unanswered text later in the evening. 

  1. The court rejected these arguments, stating that expert testimony would be needed to establish a connection between withdrawal symptoms and overdose risk.

  2. The court also found that not responding to a text message late at night was not a reasonable indication of immediate danger.

### 2. Requirements for Establishing Involuntary Manslaughter in Drug Sales

- **Key Points**

  - Knowledge that the heroin sold was especially potent or contained fentanyl could be considered "more".

  - Special circumstances surrounding the supply, beyond a simple business transaction, could qualify as "more".

  - Aggressive behavior by the dealer, such as repeatedly waking up a user to consume more drugs, could be considered "more".

  - Selling drugs to someone in visible distress and then abandoning them could qualify as "more".

- **Explanation** 

  The court examined various scenarios from other cases to illustrate what could constitute the "more" required beyond just selling drugs. These examples provide guidance on what circumstances might elevate a drug sale to involuntary manslaughter.

- **Hypothetical Scenario with Additional Circumstances** 

  > A scenario where the victim's girlfriend begged the dealer not to provide more heroin due to fear of overdose, which the dealer denied. 

  1. This scenario might be enough to affirm a conviction, as it provides additional context beyond just the sale of drugs.

  2. In reviewing such a conviction, the court would have to accept the girlfriend's statement as fact and discredit the dealer's denial.

### 3. Felony Murder and the Merger Doctrine

- **Key Points**

  - Felony murder is based on the concept of imputed mens rea from the underlying felony.

  - The merger doctrine prevents certain assaultive crimes from being used as predicates for felony murder.

  - The determination of whether a crime is assaultive in nature is left to the jury.

- **Explanation** 

  The court discusses the differences between first-degree and second-degree felony murder in Nevada. The merger doctrine is explained as a way to prevent certain crimes that are inherently part of the murder itself from being used as the underlying felony for felony murder charges. The court decides that the jury should determine whether a crime is assaultive in nature based on how it was committed, rather than just looking at the statutory definition of the crime.

- **Rose v. State Case Facts** 

  > Brian Rose was convicted of second-degree murder. The circumstances of the case involved a potentially accidental shooting where Rose claimed he didn't believe the gun was loaded. 

  1. The court considered whether the facts could support a finding of murder with an "abandoned and malignant heart" (implied malice).

  2. The ambiguity of the circumstances and Rose's apparent remorse complicated the determination of his mental state.

- **Application of Merger Doctrine in Rose v. State** 

  > The court had to determine whether the underlying felony (assault with a deadly weapon) should merge with the murder charge. 

  1. The court ruled that assaultive crimes can merge with the murder charge, potentially preventing their use as predicates for felony murder.

  2. The case was reversed and remanded for a new trial where the jury would need to determine if the underlying crime was assaultive in nature.

### 4. Felony Murder and Assaultive Crimes

- **Key Points**

  - Jury instructions for assaultive crimes in felony murder cases

  - The impact of finding a crime assaultive on felony murder charges

  - Prosecutorial strategy in pursuing felony murder theory

  - The role of jury discretion in determining if a crime was assaultive

- **Explanation** 

  In felony murder cases, juries must be instructed on whether the underlying crime was assaultive, meaning it put someone in fear of imminent physical harm. If a crime is found to be assaultive, it may not lead to a felony murder conviction due to the merger doctrine. Prosecutors often pursue felony murder charges because they don't have to prove the traditional elements of second-degree murder, only that a felony was committed and a murder resulted. Juries have discretion in determining whether a crime was assaultive, but they may be influenced by the fact that a murder occurred.

- **Hypothetical Russian Roulette Scenario** 

  > A hypothetical situation where people were playing Russian roulette while drinking, resulting in an accidental shooting. 

  1. In this scenario, the jury might find that the crime was not assaultive due to the joking and fun nature of the activity, despite the fatal outcome.

  2. This example illustrates how context and circumstances can influence the jury's determination of whether a crime was assaultive.

### 5. Lesser Included Offenses and Charging Practices

- **Key Points**

  - Variation in charging practices across different states

  - Possibility of lesser included charges not explicitly in the indictment

  - Court's discretion in allowing lesser included charges

- **Explanation** 

  The handling of lesser included offenses varies by state. In some cases, lesser charges may be implied with a greater one, while in others, they need to be explicitly listed in the indictment. Courts have discretion to allow the prosecution to pursue lesser included charges even if they weren't originally in the indictment, depending on how the facts of the case unfold during trial. This practice is not uniform and can differ based on jurisdiction and specific case circumstances.

- **Tracy Stewart Case** 

  > A case involving Tracy Stewart charged with felony murder based on an unusual underlying felony statute. 

  1. The case involves a charge of secondary felony murder against Tracy Stewart.

  2. The underlying felony is described as unusual, highlighting the variability in felony murder statutes and their application.

### 6. Felony Murder in Rhode Island

- **Key Points**

  - First-degree felony murder involves death resulting from enumerated crimes

  - Second-degree felony murder requires an inherently dangerous underlying felony

  - The jury determines whether a crime is inherently dangerous

- **Explanation** 

  The court in Rhode Island rejects the California approach of looking at crimes in the abstract to determine if they are inherently dangerous. Instead, they allow the jury to look at the facts of each case to decide if the crime was inherently dangerous. This approach makes it difficult for defendants to argue that a crime resulting in death was not inherently dangerous.

- **State v. Stewart - Felony Murder Case in Rhode Island** 

  > Carla Stewart was charged with felony murder after her baby died of dehydration during a cocaine binge. The underlying felony was permitting a child to be a habitual sufferer. 

  1. Stewart argued that the habitual sufferer statute was not inherently dangerous, based on the California approach of examining crimes in the abstract.

  2. The Rhode Island court rejected this view, stating that the jury should look at the facts of each case to determine if a crime is inherently dangerous.

  3. Stewart also argued insufficient evidence of intent, but the court rejected this based on her history of drug use and neglect of her child.

### 7. Felony Murder in New York - People v. Hernandez and Santana

- **Key Points**

  - New York's statute applies when a felony causes the death of a person other than the participants

  - The court uses a proximate cause analysis to determine felony murder liability

  - Accomplice liability can extend felony murder charges to all participants in the underlying felony

- **Explanation** 

  The court rejected the previous agency theory established in the Wood case, which required the killing to be committed by one of the participants in the underlying crime. Under the new statute and proximate cause approach, felony murder can apply when the death is a foreseeable result of the felony, even if caused by someone other than the defendants.

- **People v. Hernandez and Santana - Felony Murder Case in New York** 

  > Hernandez and Santana were charged with felony murder after a police officer was killed by friendly fire during a shootout that occurred while apprehending Hernandez following an attempted robbery. 

  1. The court found that the death was a foreseeable consequence of Hernandez's actions in fleeing from the crime scene with a gun and confronting police.

  2. Although Santana was hiding and not directly involved in the shootout, he was still charged with felony murder due to accomplice liability.

  3. The case demonstrates the application of the proximate cause approach in felony murder cases under the new New York statute.

### 8. Felony Murder in Kansas - State v. Sophophone

- **Key Points**

  - Aggravated burglary is statutorily defined as an inherently dangerous felony in Kansas

  - The case involves a motion to dismiss a criminal complaint

  - The defendant argued that the complaint was defective in its wording about who killed the co-felon

- **Explanation** 

  The case highlights the importance of precise language in criminal complaints and the potential for technical arguments in felony murder cases. It also demonstrates how states may statutorily define certain felonies as inherently dangerous for the purpose of felony murder charges.

- **State v. Sophophone - Motion to Dismiss Felony Murder Complaint in Kansas** 

  > Sophophone was charged with aggravated burglary and felony murder. He filed a motion to dismiss the complaint based on its wording regarding who killed his co-felon. 

  1. The case was at the stage of a motion to dismiss a criminal complaint, similar to a motion to dismiss an indictment in other jurisdictions.

  2. Sophophone's argument focused on a technical issue with the wording of the complaint, claiming it incorrectly stated that he, rather than the police, killed his co-felon.

  3. The court's decision on this motion was not provided in the given transcript, leaving the outcome uncertain.

### 9. Felony Murder Rule in Kansas

- **Key Points**

  - The statutory language defines felony murder as "the killing of a human being committed in the flight from an inherently dangerous felony".

  - The court interpreted that the killing must be committed by one of the defendants, not by a police officer.

  - The court's interpretation differs from other jurisdictions where this theory of felony murder might apply.

- **Explanation** 

  The court analyzed the statutory language and concluded that it does not fit the government's theory in this case. The killing of the co-felon was committed by a police officer, not by one of the defendants during their flight. This interpretation restricts the application of the felony murder rule in Kansas compared to other jurisdictions.

- **Case of co-felon shot by police officer during escape attempt** 

  > In this case, a co-felon was shot by a police officer while trying to escape. The defendant was already under arrest in the car. The prosecutor attempted to apply the felony murder rule to hold the defendant responsible for the death of the co-felon. 

  1. The court rejected the prosecutor's theory because the killing was not committed by one of the defendants.

  2. The statutory language was interpreted to require that the killing be committed by a defendant during the flight from the felony.

  3. The court acknowledged that this theory of felony murder might work in other jurisdictions, but not under Kansas statutory language.

### 10. Controversial Topics in Legal Education

- **Key Points**

  - Some law schools have stopped teaching rape law due to its controversial nature.

  - The professor decides to include rape law in the curriculum despite potential discomfort.

  - Discussion on the necessity of teaching sensitive topics for comprehensive legal education.

- **Explanation** 

  The professor acknowledges that teaching rape law can be uncomfortable and shocking, but argues that it would be patronizing to exclude it from the curriculum. The class discussion touches on the broader issues of campus politics and the importance of addressing difficult topics in education.

- **Campus sexual assault case and Title IX audit** 

  > A student mentions that their school had to hire a top-third in the country auditor to review their Title IX department due to its poor handling of sexual assault cases. 

  1. The example illustrates the real-world relevance of studying rape law and related policies.

  2. It highlights the ongoing challenges in addressing sexual assault on college campuses.

  3. The need for proper education and training on these issues is emphasized.

`Rape Cases` `Resistance Requirements` `Legal Standards`
## Theme
This lecture discusses legal standards in rape cases, focusing on the requirement for victim resistance and the evolving interpretation of this requirement across different jurisdictions. It examines the State v. Jones case in Idaho, comparing it with Washington's State v. McKnight case, and explores how courts determine the sufficiency of resistance. The lecture also covers the elements of force, consent, and threats in rape cases, highlighting the variations in legal standards across different states.
## Takeaways
 1. State v. Jones case discussion
 2. Charges against Jones: two counts of forcible rape
 3. Idaho's statute requiring resistance in rape cases
 4. Court's inquiry into the amount of resistance required
 5. Comparison with Washington state's statute and precedent
 6. Washington's State v. McKnight case and its standard for resistance
 7. Idaho's adoption of a similar test to Washington's
 8. Physical resistance not required, fact-sensitive determination
 9. Geographical discussion of Idaho's neighboring states and Canadian provinces
10. Discussion of rape cases and legal standards for force and consent
## Highlights
- `"at this time Idaho is into the minority in still requiring resistance."-- Prof Rehnquist`
- `"Physical resistance is not required. The amount of resistance that is required, is going to be a fact-sensitive inquiry taking in all of the facts and circumstances including, in this midnight case, the age of the victim."-- Prof Rehnquist`
- `"Force is an essential element of the crime, and to justify a conviction, the evidence must warrant a conclusion either that the victim resisted and her resistance was overcome by force or that she was prevented from resisting by threat secrecy."-- Speaker 5 《Hazel v. State case》`
- `"Verdicts have consequences. They're important."-- Prof Rehnquist`
- `"We summarize the facts the jury could have found."-- Prof Rehnquist`
## Chapters & Topics
### Resistance Requirement in Rape Cases
> The legal requirement for victims to demonstrate resistance in rape cases, with a focus on Idaho's minority position and the evolving standards in comparison to other states.
- **Keypoints**
  - Idaho maintains a minority position by still requiring resistance in rape cases
  - The court must determine the amount of resistance required
  - Washington's precedent (State v. McKnight) is used for comparison
  - Physical resistance is not necessarily required
  - Resistance is determined through a fact-sensitive inquiry
- **Explanation**
  The court in State v. Jones is examining the resistance requirement in rape cases. Idaho, being in the minority, still requires some form of resistance from the victim. The court is tasked with determining what level of resistance is sufficient. To do this, they look at precedents from other states, particularly Washington's State v. McKnight case. The emerging standard suggests that physical resistance is not mandatory, but rather the determination of resistance should be based on a comprehensive examination of all facts and circumstances surrounding the incident.
- **Examples**
  > In State v. McKnight, the Washington court established a precedent for determining resistance in rape cases. This case involved the forcible rape of a 14-year-old girl.
  - The Washington court ruled that the state does not need to show that the victim physically resisted
  - The court determined that the question of whether resistance occurred is a fact-sensitive determination
  - The age of the victim (14 years old) was considered as a relevant factor in this determination
- **Considerations**
- The age of the victim may be a relevant factor in determining the expected level of resistance
- Physical resistance is not the only form of resistance that can be considered
- Courts may look to other states' precedents when interpreting similar statutes
- **Special Circumstances**
- If encountering a case with a young victim, how should the expected level of resistance be adjusted?
- If dealing with a case where no physical resistance was shown, how should other forms of resistance be evaluated?
### Legal Standards for Rape Cases
> The legal requirements and standards for proving rape charges, including elements of force, consent, and threats.
- **Keypoints**
  - Force is an essential element of rape in some jurisdictions
  - Evidence must show victim resistance was overcome by force or prevented by threats
  - Sufficiency of evidence for threats is a key issue in some cases
  - Consent and lack of consent may be treated differently in statutes
  - Intent requirements may not apply to all elements of rape charges
- **Explanation**
  In rape cases, courts must consider various factors including the use of force, presence of threats, victim resistance, and consent. The specific requirements can vary by jurisdiction. Appellate courts may review whether there was sufficient evidence to support convictions based on these elements.
- **Examples**
  > Case involving rape charges where the court examined sufficiency of evidence for threats. The victim claimed she was frightened by the defendant's actions and tone of voice.
  - Court considered whether taking keys, defendant's tone, and other actions constituted sufficient threats
  - Debate over whether evidence was enough to even allow jury consideration
  - Dissenting opinion argued this was a factual issue for jury to decide
  > Case examining elements of rape under Massachusetts law and debate over mistake-of-fact instructions
  - Elements include intercourse, compulsion by force/threat, and lack of consent
  - Court refused mistake-of-fact instruction on consent
  - Intent requirement does not apply to lack of consent element
- **Considerations**
- Importance of jury verdicts and standards for appellate review
- Balancing defendant rights with victim protection in rape cases
- Varying statutory language and requirements across jurisdictions
- **Special Circumstances**
- If encountering a case with ambiguous consent, how should courts handle mistake-of-fact instructions?
- If facing conflicting testimony between victim and defendant, how should appellate courts approach sufficiency of evidence reviews?

## Highlights
- `"The movement off of a window base. Four to six inches towards the door is a fair removal from the place in which the thief found it."-- 《Supreme Court of North Carolina ruling》`
- `"Obtaining money or property from another with their consent induced by the actual wrongful use of actual or threatened fear."-- 《Definition of extortion under the Hobbs Act》`
- `"Among the reasons why the error was harmless is that the jury convicted Villalobos for obstruction of justice."`
- `"I would leave it as vague as possible. Just I'm getting together with David Becker. You know I represent whatever that name was."`
- `"This is an interesting example of how, you know, in interpreting statutes, sometimes the common law can bleed into the court's analysis of the elements of a statute, even when it's not really appropriate here."`
- `"Wait three months. Three months, you can probably tell somewhere in the Dominion Power, I'm picturing kind of like a control center, right? You can probably tell. You can watch the needle move on how much power they're using, and wait until it gets to 201, okay, and then pounce."-- Charlie`
- `"The court said, as noted above, blah. And in the middle of the paragraph, there's four dots, an ellipsis, right? Here's my question. Anybody. What was in that ellipsis before the editors of this book removed it?"-- 《Marsh v. Commonwealth case discussion》`
- `"The court basically argues that the relationship that the brothers and later Solomon have had basically created a scenario of mutual benefit."-- 《Salman v. United States case discussion》`
## Chapters & Topics
1. **Criminal Law Case Discussion: Rex Carswell**
   > Rex Carswell was convicted of felonious breaking and entering and felonious larceny. He received consecutive sentences of 10 and 5 years. The case was appealed to the Court of Appeals and then to the Supreme Court of North Carolina. The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision, ruling that moving a window air conditioner 4-6 inches constituted sufficient evidence of taking/asportation for larceny.
   - Rex Carswell was charged with felonious breaking and entering and felonious larceny.
   - He received consecutive sentences of 10 and 5 years.
   - The case involved breaking into 5-6 rooms of a motel under construction.
   - The Court of Appeals found insufficient evidence of taking/asportation.
   - The Supreme Court of North Carolina reversed, ruling that moving an air conditioner 4-6 inches was sufficient for larceny.
2. **Criminal Law Case Discussion: United States v. Villalobos**
   > Alfred Villalobos was convicted of attempted extortion under the Hobbs Act. The case involved a complex scheme with Rabbi Yemeni, who was under investigation for visa fraud. Villalobos, acting as a lawyer, attempted to extort money from Rabbi Yemeni in exchange for favorable testimony from a witness. The conviction was appealed based on erroneous jury instructions and the preclusion of a claim of right defense.
   - Alfred Villalobos was charged with attempted extortion under the Hobbs Act.
   - The case stemmed from an underlying investigation into Rabbi Yemeni's visa fraud scheme.
   - Villalobos attempted to extort money from Rabbi Yemeni in exchange for favorable testimony.
   - Jeffrey Gluck, Rabbi Yemeni's lawyer, wore a wire to record conversations with Villalobos.
   - Villalobos appealed his conviction based on erroneous jury instructions and preclusion of a claim of right defense.
   - The appeal court found the jury instruction on "wrongful" to be erroneous and not harmless error.
3. **Villalobos Case and Obstruction of Justice**
   > The Ninth Circuit found that the error in Villalobos' case was harmless because the jury convicted him of obstruction of justice. The court determined that the nature of the threat made Villalobos' action criminal, regardless of any claim of right to the money.
   - The jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that the threat implicitly included the possibility of obstructing justice.
   - The Ninth Circuit ruled that Villalobos' claim of right argument was irrelevant to the conviction.
   - The nature of the threat made the action criminal, regardless of whether Villalobos thought he had a legitimate claim to the money.
4. **Hypothetical Extortion Case**
   > The lecture presents a hypothetical case involving a former porn star considering selling her story about a consensual sexual relationship with a presidential candidate. The discussion explores the legal and ethical implications of negotiating such a deal, including potential extortion or blackmail concerns.
   - The hypothetical involves a client named Zephyr Daniels, a former porn star, wanting to sell her story about a consensual relationship with a presidential candidate.
   - The lawyer is asked to contact the candidate's lawyer, who is the number two person at the Department of Justice.
   - The discussion explores various approaches to negotiating, including vague communication and potential use of a foundation to receive payments.
   - The case raises questions about the line between legitimate negotiations and potential extortion or blackmail.
5. **Penley Case - Obtaining Utility Service by Fraud**
   > The case involves Thomas Penley being charged with obtaining utility service by fraud in Virginia. The court applied common law principles of larceny in interpreting the statute, which led to a discussion about the appropriateness of using common law in statutory interpretation.
   - The charge was obtaining utility service by fraud, a statutory crime in Virginia.
   - The statute specifies utility fraud as a class one misdemeanor, becoming a felony if the amount exceeds $200.
   - The case involved an illegal meter discovered by Dominion Power.
   - The Court of Appeals applied common law principles of larceny in interpreting the statute, specifically regarding the valuation of services at the time they were taken.
   - The lecture questions the appropriateness of applying common law principles when the statute is clear.
6. **Legal Advice for Dominion Power**
   > The lecturer suggests that Dominion Power should wait three months before bringing charges, allowing power usage to reach 201 units before taking action. This strategy would ensure all charges are felonious.
   - Wait three months before bringing charges
   - Monitor power usage until it reaches 201 units
   - Timing the charges will make all offenses felonious
7. **Marsh v. Commonwealth Case**
   > Bernard Chesley Marsh was convicted of grand larceny. He received a sentence of four years, with three and a half years suspended, resulting in a six-month active sentence. The case highlights the importance of the defendant's ability to return stolen property and the potential pitfalls of certain legal defenses.
   - Marsh was charged with grand larceny
   - He was convicted in a bench trial
   - The sentence was four years with three and a half years suspended
   - The defense strategy of claiming intent to return property backfired
   - Elements of larceny include wrongful taking, intent to deprive, and value of goods
8. **Salman v. United States Case**
   > Bassam Salman was convicted of insider trading. He received insider information second-hand through family connections. The court rejected Salman's argument that the tipper should receive direct financial benefit, affirming that close relationships can create scenarios of mutual benefit sufficient for insider trading charges.
   - Salman was charged with securities fraud, specifically insider trading
   - The total profit from the trading was $1.5 million, which Salman split with his broker
   - Salman was convicted on all counts
   - The court affirmed that close relationships can constitute a breach of trust in insider trading cases
   - Victims in insider trading cases are considered to be other traders or the market itself
## Suggestions
- Consider the impact of sentencing information on jury decisions in criminal cases.
- Reflect on the fine line between attempted larceny and completed larceny in legal definitions.
- Consider the ethical implications of lawyers becoming involved in their clients' illegal activities.
- Reflect on the fine line between legitimate legal negotiation and extortion in complex cases.
- When dealing with potential extortion cases, consider the nature of the threat rather than just the claim to money.
- When handling sensitive information that could be valuable to media outlets, lawyers must carefully consider the legal and ethical implications of their actions.
- When interpreting statutes, be cautious about applying common law principles if the statute is clear and unambiguous.
- Strategically time legal actions to maximize the impact of the statute
- Choosing a bench trial for technical legal defenses may be strategically beneficial in some cases
- Be cautious of receiving and acting on information from close family or friends that could be considered insider trading

## Highlights
- `"If there's no knowledge that there is a proceeding, there can't be obstruction, okay?"-- Prof Rehnquist`
- `"Can a single non-responsive answer in a grand jury proceeding be obstruction?"-- Prof Rehnquist`
- `"If he doesn't know there's a proceeding... can't be convicted."-- Prof Rehnquist`
- `"You must read the statute so that all of its parts make sense."-- Prof Rehnquist`
- `"Verdicts have consequences, okay? It's good to win at trial, okay, because on appeal, an appellate court will be very deferential, to the jury."-- Prof Rehnquist`
- `"The same principles you learned in tort about proximate cause and foreseeability apply criminally as well, okay?"-- Prof Rehnquist`
- `"See, every state has a different way they describe their worst kind of murder, okay?"-- Prof Rehnquist`
- `"We learned that under the common law of most states, there are only specified things, a list of five specified things, that are sufficient to get an instruction on voluntary manslaughter instead of murder."-- Prof Rehnquist`
- `"Marjorie knowler okay Marjorie knowler you know in the you know in the Grinch stole Christmas like there's that scene where they talk about how his heart grows, You know, and it gets huge. Marjorie Nolert had a bad, her art was abandoned and malignant."-- Prof Rehnquist`
- `"The court found that if the underlying crime was an assaultive type of crime, it would merge with the actual murder and that could not be the basis for felony murder."-- Prof Rehnquist`
- `"The intent to permanently deprive, his defense was, just borrowing it for a while. Okay? And of course there's some law that makes that hard to prove."-- Prof Rehnquist`
## Chapters & Topics
 1. **United States v. Aguilar Case Review**
    > The case involved Judge Robert Aguilar who was convicted of endeavoring to obstruct justice. The key issue was whether lying to FBI agents constituted obstruction of justice under 18 U.S.C. 1503. The Supreme Court ruled that there must be a specific nexus between the act of obstruction and the proceeding, which was not established in Aguilar's case.
    - Robert Aguilar, a federal judge, was convicted of endeavoring to obstruct justice.
    - The case intersected with another case involving Michael Rudy Tham, an officer of the International Department of Defense.
    - Aguilar learned about a wiretap and tried to inform someone named in it, which was seen as an attempt to impede the investigation.
    - The Supreme Court ruled that there must be a specific nexus between the obstructive act and the proceeding for it to constitute obstruction under 18 U.S.C. 1503.
    - The government did not charge Aguilar under 18 U.S.C. 1001 (federal false statement statute) due to the "exculpatory no" exception at the time.
 2. **Barry Bonds Obstruction Case**
    > Barry Bonds was charged with four counts of false statements and one count of obstruction of justice. He was convicted only on the obstruction charge, which was later overturned by the Ninth Circuit Court due to lack of materiality in his non-responsive answer during grand jury questioning about his trainer, Greg Anderson.
    - Bonds was originally charged with four counts of false statements under 18 U.S.C. 1001 and one count of obstruction of justice.
    - He was convicted only on the obstruction charge.
    - The obstruction charge was based on a non-responsive answer about his trainer, Greg Anderson, during grand jury questioning.
    - The Ninth Circuit Court identified materiality as a fourth element in obstruction cases involving statements.
    - The conviction was overturned because the non-responsive statement was not deemed material to the grand jury's investigation.
 3. **Capitol Trespass Case and Obstruction of Justice**
    > The lecture discusses a case involving a man named Fisher who trespassed into the Capitol on January 6, 2021, during the certification of electors for the 2020 election. The case revolves around the interpretation of the obstruction of justice statute, specifically 18 U.S.C. § 1503(c)(2). The Supreme Court, in a split decision, reversed the D.C. Circuit's ruling on the interpretation of the statute.
    - Fisher allegedly had a physical altercation with police inside the Capitol.
    - The proceeding in question was the certification of electors for the 2020 election.
    - To be convicted of obstruction, the defendant must be aware of the proceeding they are obstructing.
    - The case primarily focuses on statutory interpretation of 18 U.S.C. § 1503(c)(2).
    - The Supreme Court opinions include arguments about language construction, congressional intent, and criticism of the majority's interpretation.
 4. **Statutory Interpretation Principles**
    > The lecture discusses various principles of statutory interpretation used in analyzing the obstruction of justice statute. These include the plain meaning rule, structural arguments, and the use of dictionaries. The majority opinion, concurrence, and dissent each use different approaches to interpret the statute.
    - The plain meaning rule suggests interpreting statutes according to their literal, ordinary meaning.
    - Justice Barrett's dissent uses dictionary definitions to support a broad interpretation of "otherwise" in the statute.
    - The majority uses structural arguments to interpret the statute, considering how different parts of the law fit together.
    - Justice Jackson's concurrence argues that a broad interpretation of the statute would make other specific obstruction statutes pointless.
 5. **Review of Key Concepts in Criminal Law**
    > The lecture concludes with a review of important concepts in criminal law that have been discussed throughout the course. These include elements of offenses, the role of the jury, jury instructions, the consequences of verdicts, punishment, the role of common law, fair warning, the principle of lenity, mental states, and mistakes of fact.
    - Elements of offenses are crucial in determining criminal liability.
    - Jury instructions are often the basis for appeals in criminal cases.
    - Appellate courts are generally deferential to jury verdicts.
    - Common law still influences the interpretation of modern statutes.
    - Fair warning is an important principle in criminal law, ensuring that statutes clearly define prohibited conduct.
    - Mental states, such as "corruptly" or "willfully," are important in defining criminal offenses.
    - Mistakes of fact can sometimes serve as a defense in criminal cases.
 6. **Causation in Criminal Law**
    > The principles of proximate cause and foreseeability from tort law also apply in criminal law. The Michelle Carter case was discussed as an example where the court found she caused her friend's suicide by telling him to get back in the truck.
    - The "take your victim as you find them" principle applies in criminal law
    - Proximate cause and foreseeability are important concepts in analyzing criminal causation
    - The Michelle Carter case established that encouraging suicide can be considered causation
 7. **Intentional Murder**
    > Different states have varying terminology and standards for the worst kind of murder. Cases like Taylor, Bullock, and Guthrie were discussed to illustrate different standards such as premeditation and prior calculation and design.
    - States use different terms like first degree, aggravated, or malice aforethought for intentional murder
    - Premeditation is a key factor in some jurisdictions
    - Some states use standards like "prior calculation and design"
    - The amount of time required for premeditation varies by case and jurisdiction
 8. **Voluntary Manslaughter**
    > Voluntary manslaughter typically requires specific circumstances to reduce a murder charge. The common law recognizes only five specified things that can lead to a voluntary manslaughter instruction. Some states, like New Jersey, have more lenient rules.
    - Common law recognizes five specific circumstances for voluntary manslaughter
    - The Gerard case involved a man stabbing his wife during an argument
    - The Castagna case in New Jersey showed a more lenient approach to voluntary manslaughter
    - Threat of harm to a family member or friend can be grounds for voluntary manslaughter in some jurisdictions
 9. **Reckless Killings**
    > Reckless killings involve different statutory language across jurisdictions. Cases like Coswell (baby left in car), Marjorie Knowler, and Snyder (attempted infanticide) were discussed to illustrate various standards such as recklessness and depravity.
    - Reckless killings have varying statutory language across jurisdictions
    - The Coswell case involved a reckless mens rea for leaving a baby in a car
    - The Marjorie Knowler case illustrated an extremely malicious intent
    - The Snyder case involved attempted infanticide and the concept of "depraved heart" murder
10. **Felony Murder**
> Felony murder doctrine varies by state, with issues such as merger, inherently dangerous felonies, and proximate cause being key considerations. Cases like Rose, Stewart, Hernandez, and Sophophone were discussed to illustrate different aspects of felony murder rules.
```
- The merger doctrine prevents assaultive crimes from being the basis for felony murder
Some jurisdictions consider whether the underlying felony is "inherently dangerous"Proximate cause analysis is used in some felony murder casesStatutory interpretation can limit felony murder liability, as in the Sophophone case
```
11. **Theft and Property Crimes**
> Larceny has specific rules, including the concept of "exportation" and the requirement of intent to permanently deprive. Securities fraud and insider trading were also briefly mentioned.
```
- Larceny requires intent to permanently deprive the owner of property"Borrowing" is not a valid defense if intent to permanently deprive can be provenSecurities fraud and insider trading were covered in the course
```
## Suggestions
- Never talk to the FBI without proper legal representation, as any false statement can be considered a federal crime.
- A pattern of non-responsive answers could potentially constitute obstruction of justice, even if a single instance may not.
- When interpreting statutes, consider not only the plain meaning but also structural arguments and the potential consequences of different interpretations.
- When interpreting statutes, consider multiple principles of construction and how they may lead to different outcomes.
- When analyzing criminal cases, consider multiple aspects including statutory interpretation, jury instructions, and potential defenses such as mistakes of fact.
- Carefully consider the chain of events and foreseeability when analyzing criminal causation
- Pay attention to the specific language and standards used in different jurisdictions when analyzing murder cases
- Consider the potential implications of more lenient voluntary manslaughter rules, as seen in the New Jersey case
- Pay attention to the specific statutory language used in different jurisdictions for reckless killings
- Consider the specific statutory language and judicial interpretations when analyzing felony murder cases in different jurisdictions

> Date & Time: 2025-03-10 18:02:01

> Speaker: Professor Rehnquist

## Theme

Understanding the nuances of perjury and various criminal law concepts is crucial for legal professionals. Precise questioning, careful interpretation of legal precedents, and consideration of context are essential in practicing law effectively.

## Takeaways

1. A non-responsive but literally true answer that is misleading is not perjury, as ruled in the Bronson case.

2. Perjury requires intentionally stating a material matter known to be false under oath.

3. Materiality in perjury cases is broadly defined as any false statement that could influence the jury's judgment of credibility.

4. The "dangerous proximity to success" test is used to determine when a plan becomes an attempted crime, as shown in the Rizzo case.

5. Impossibility and abandonment are potential defenses in attempted crime cases.

6. Criminal contempt cases consider factors such as prior warning, impact on fact-finder, pattern of behavior, and significance of the issue.

## Highlights

- `"A non-responsive but literally true answer that is misleading is not perjury."-- 《Bronson case ruling》`

- `"If any of you become prosecutors, you charge somebody with perjury, a non-responsive answer, I will deny that I ever met you."-- Lecturer`

- `"Trial judges must be on guard against confusing offenses to their sensibilities with obstruction to the administration of justice."-- 《United States Supreme Court admonition》`

- `"There must be dangerous proximity to success."-- 《Test for attempted crime in Rizzo case》`

## Chapters & Topics

1. **Perjury Cases: Bronson and Danielson**

   > The lecture discusses two significant perjury cases: Bronson and Danielson. In Bronson, the Supreme Court ruled that a non-responsive but literally true answer that is misleading is not perjury. The case emphasized the importance of precise questioning by lawyers. In Danielson, a South Dakota case, the defendant was acquitted of grand theft auto parts but later charged with perjury for his testimony in that trial. The lecture explores the elements of perjury, the prosecution's approach, and the challenges in proving perjury.

   - Bronson case: The Supreme Court ruled that a non-responsive but literally true answer, even if misleading, does not constitute perjury.

   - Perjury requires a false statement of fact, not just a mistake or misleading information.

   - The Danielson case involved a mechanic accused of grand theft auto parts, who was acquitted but later charged with perjury.

   - Elements of perjury include intentionally stating a material matter known to be false under oath.

   - Prosecutors used expert testimony from three trace experts to prove the falsity of Danielson's statements.

2. **Legal Cases and Concepts in Criminal Law**

   > The lecture covers several legal cases and concepts related to criminal law, including materiality in perjury cases, criminal contempt, attempted robbery, and attempted murder. The cases discussed include Danielson's perjury case, Jefferson's criminal contempt case, Rizzo's attempted robbery case, Smith's attempted murder case, and Ross's attempted rape case. Each case illustrates different aspects of criminal law, such as materiality, intent, impossibility, and abandonment.

   - In Danielson's perjury case, the court defines materiality broadly, considering any false statement that could influence the jury's judgment of credibility as material.

   - Jefferson's criminal contempt case highlights the factors courts consider when determining if a lawyer's behavior warrants a contempt citation, including prior warning, impact on fact-finder, pattern of behavior, and significance of the issue.

   - Rizzo's attempted robbery case demonstrates the concept of "dangerous proximity to success" as a test for when a plan becomes an attempted crime.

   - Smith's attempted murder case involves the concept of impossibility as a defense and the importance of intent in attempted crimes.

   - Ross's attempted rape case touches on the concept of abandonment as a defense in criminal law.

## Suggestions

- Lawyers should be precise in their questioning to avoid ambiguity that could lead to non-responsive answers.

- Prosecuting perjury based on non-responsive answers is discouraged as it may be seen as a weak case and potentially vindictive.

- When analyzing legal cases, it's important to read between the lines and consider context that may not be explicitly stated in the court's opinion.

- Understanding the nuances of criminal law concepts like attempt, impossibility, and abandonment is crucial for interpreting and applying the law effectively.

4. Renunciation defense in conspiracy law can be stringent, as seen in the Marshfield High School case.
5. Terrorism-related conspiracy cases present unique challenges in determining material support and intent.
6. The plain language analysis of statutes plays a crucial role in interpreting conspiracy laws.
7. Conspiracy charges can be applied in various contexts, from drug deals to school shooting plots.
8. The balance between strict application of law and creating incentives for crime prevention is debated.
## Highlights
- `"Has he committed attempted murder on those facts."-- [Speaker 1]`
- `"Plain language analysis, plain meaning. The word agreement means to agree."-- [Speaker 1]`
- `"The actus reus is the agreement."-- [Speaker 1]`
- `"June of 2001."-- [Speaker 11]`
- `"Okay, so if you agree, you don't really have to do anything else, do you? Because the agreement is the act. That's the fiction, right?"-- [Speaker 1] 《Lecture on Conspiracy Law》`
- `"We are, and you're right. But this kind of a case isn't the only place where these kinds of legal fictions are used. They are used throughout the law of conspiracy."-- [Speaker 1] 《Lecture on Conspiracy Law》`
- `"All it takes is one conspirator to commit an overt act, and the overt act requirement is satisfied."-- [Speaker 1] 《Lecture on Conspiracy Law》`
- `"Sullivan and Farley got immunity, testified against Knee. Kearns was also indicted, he was convicted, he served a ten month sentence in a separate trial. Knee served a nine month sentence, obviously their sentence was longer than they got out."-- [Speaker 1] 《Lecture on the Marshfield High School Conspiracy Case》`
- `"Do we want to have incentives for people to come, fess up, turn themselves in, prevent the crime? that might be happening should it really be that hard"-- [Speaker 1] 《Lecture on Renunciation Defense in Conspiracy Law》`
## Chapters & Topics
1. **Attempted Murder Case Discussion**
   > The case involves Pacheco, who was charged with attempted murder and conspiracy. He agreed to provide protection for two cocaine deals and a third agreement to kill someone. Pacheco went to a hotel lobby with a gun but did not contact the intended victim before leaving and being arrested. The jury found him not guilty of attempted murder, but the conspiracy charge was appealed.
   - Pacheco provided protection for two cocaine deals and was paid for it.
   - A third agreement involved killing someone who had been shortchanged in a drug deal.
   - Pacheco went to a hotel lobby with a gun but did not contact the intended victim.
   - The jury found Pacheco not guilty of attempted murder.
   - The case went to appeal on the conspiracy charge.
2. **Conspiracy Law and Bilateral Agreement Requirement**
   > The appeals court in Nevada construed the conspiracy statute to require a bilateral agreement, not a unilateral one. This interpretation was based on the plain language analysis of the word "agreement" and the rationale behind conspiracy law, which focuses on the dangers of group criminality. The court also considered that a bilateral requirement could prevent potential entrapment or manufacturing of crimes by law enforcement.
   - The Nevada appeals court interpreted the conspiracy statute to require a bilateral agreement.
   - The interpretation was based on the plain meaning of "agreement" in dictionaries.
   - Conspiracy law is concerned with the dangers of group criminality.
   - A bilateral requirement may prevent potential entrapment or manufacturing of crimes.
   - One judge dissented, arguing that entrapment defense could address concerns about manufactured crimes.
3. **U.S. v. Shabani and Overt Act Requirement in Conspiracy**
   > In U.S. v. Shabani, the Supreme Court decided that the federal drug conspiracy statute does not require proof of an overt act. This decision was based on the absence of explicit language requiring an overt act in the statute, contrasting with other federal conspiracy statutes that do include such language. The Court rejected arguments about punishing thoughts and ambiguity in the statute.
   - The Supreme Court ruled that the federal drug conspiracy statute does not require proof of an overt act.
   - The decision was based on the absence of explicit language in the statute requiring an overt act.
   - The Court contrasted this with 18 U.S.C. 371, which explicitly requires an overt act.
   - The Court rejected the argument that this punishes thoughts, stating that the agreement itself is the actus reus.
   - The Court also rejected the argument of ambiguity in the statute, stating it was clear there was no overt act requirement.
4. **Abu Ghaith Case and Material Support for Terrorism**
   > Abu Ghaith, a Kuwaiti minister, was charged with providing material support or resources to Al-Qaeda. He met with Osama bin Laden in June 2001 and gave speeches at an Al-Qaeda training camp. The case highlights the complexities of determining when an individual becomes a conspirator in terrorist activities, especially given the timeline of events leading up to September 11, 2001.
   - Abu Ghaith was charged with providing material support or resources to Al-Qaeda.
   - He met with Osama bin Laden in June 2001 and gave speeches at an Al-Qaeda training camp.
   - By summer 2001, Al-Qaeda had publicly taken credit for attacks on U.S. targets.
   - Abu Ghaith sent his family back to Kuwait about six days before September 11, 2001.
   - The case raises questions about when Abu Ghaith became aware of and involved in Al-Qaeda's plans.
5. **Conspiracy Law and Terrorist Cases**
   > The lecture discusses the complexities of conspiracy law, particularly in relation to terrorist cases. It examines the case of a potential al-Qaeda conspirator and the legal implications of his actions before and after the 9/11 attacks. The discussion also touches on the concept of overt acts in conspiracy, the shoe bomber plot, and the application of conspiracy law in a high school shooting plot case.
   - The lecture examines when someone becomes a conspirator in terrorist activities, using the example of an individual who interacted with al-Qaeda around 9/11.
   - The importance of overt acts in proving conspiracy is discussed, with examples from both terrorist and non-terrorist cases.
   - The shoe bomber plot in December 2001 is mentioned as evidence of ongoing terrorist plans after 9/11.
   - A high school shooting plot case is analyzed to illustrate conspiracy law concepts.
   - The lecture highlights the complexities of determining agreement and intent in conspiracy cases.
6. **Conspiracy Law and the Overt Act Requirement**
   > The lecture discusses the overt act requirement in conspiracy law. It emphasizes that only one conspirator needs to commit an overt act for the requirement to be satisfied. The rationale behind this requirement is to increase the likelihood that the conspiracy is not just a hypothetical plan. In the case discussed, all conspirators committed overt acts.
   - Only one conspirator needs to commit an overt act to satisfy the requirement.
   - The overt act requirement helps ensure the conspiracy is not just a hypothetical plan.
   - In the case discussed, all conspirators committed overt acts.
7. **The Marshfield High School Conspiracy Case**
   > The lecture discusses a conspiracy case involving students at Marshfield High School during the 2003-2004 school year. Joseph Knee, one of the conspirators, contacted the school resource officer about the plot. The case involves four conspirators, with Knee and Kearns potentially being the leaders. Sullivan and Farley received immunity for testifying against Knee. Kearns was convicted and served a 10-month sentence, while Knee served 9 months.
   - Joseph Knee contacted the school resource officer about the plot.
   - Four conspirators were involved, with Knee and Kearns possibly being the leaders.
   - Sullivan and Farley received immunity for testifying against Knee.
   - Kearns served a 10-month sentence, and Knee served 9 months.
   - The conspiracy took place during the 2003-2004 school year.
8. **Renunciation Defense in Conspiracy Law**
   > The lecture discusses the renunciation defense in conspiracy law, focusing on its application in the Marshfield High School case. The court rejected Knee's renunciation defense, arguing that he didn't sufficiently implicate himself. The lecture questions whether the renunciation doctrine should be so stringent, suggesting that it might be beneficial to have more lenient standards to encourage conspirators to come forward and prevent crimes.
   - The court rejected Knee's renunciation defense.
   - The lecture questions whether the renunciation doctrine should be less stringent.
   - More lenient standards might encourage conspirators to come forward and prevent crimes.
   - The case occurred after the Columbine incident, which may have influenced the strict application of the law.
## Suggestions
- The case highlights the complexity of proving attempted murder, as the jury's decision shows it can be a close call even with seemingly incriminating evidence.
- The case highlights the importance of statutory interpretation in criminal law and how it can significantly impact the application of conspiracy charges.
- The case demonstrates the importance of precise statutory language in criminal law and how courts interpret legislative intent based on the presence or absence of specific requirements in different statutes.
- The case underscores the challenges in prosecuting terrorism-related charges, particularly in determining the point at which an individual's actions constitute material support or conspiracy.
- Legal fictions in conspiracy law should be applied consistently across all types of cases, not just in terrorism-related ones.
- The concept of coercion as a defense in conspiracy cases deserves further examination.
- Consider the importance of the overt act requirement in distinguishing between mere thoughts and actual criminal intent.
- Consider the complexities of determining roles and culpability in conspiracy cases, especially when some conspirators receive immunity for testifying.
- Consider the balance between strict application of conspiracy law and creating incentives for conspirators to prevent crimes.

# Class 18 - Accomplice Liability

> Date & Time: 2025-03-17 18:05:42

> Speaker: Prof Rehnquist

## Theme

The lecture provides a comprehensive overview of accomplice liability in criminal law, discussing various cases and legal principles that shape the interpretation and application of this concept. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the nuances between mere presence, knowledge, and active participation in determining criminal liability.

## Takeaways

1. Accomplice liability has evolved from common law to statutory law, often equating aiding and abetting with committing the crime.
2. Mere presence or knowledge of a crime is insufficient for accomplice liability; active participation is required.
3. The natural and probable consequences theory can extend liability to outcomes within the common enterprise of the agreed-upon action.
4. The innocent instrumentality rule is an exotic form of accomplice liability, as demonstrated in the Bailey v. Commonwealth case.
5. Under Section 2, aiders and abettors are treated as responsible as principals in criminal law.
6. Non-mutual collateral estoppel generally does not apply in criminal cases due to differences from civil cases.
7. The distinction between knowledge and purpose in criminal law can significantly impact the outcome of accomplice liability cases.

## Highlights
- `"If you aid and abet a crime, you are liable as if you committed the crime yourself."-- [Speaker 1] 《Lecture on Accomplice Liability》`
- `"Mere presence or even prior knowledge is not enough."-- [Speaker 1] 《Discussion of State v. V.T. case》`
- `"Defendant who intends to aid, abet, counsel, or procure the commission of a crime is liable for that crime as well as the natural and probable consequences."-- Speaker 15`
- `"This was not only, I mean, this is, it's a very kind of a shameless proximate cause argument. This is exactly what you were hoping the guy would do, and then you're saying, oh, you're reading cause."-- Speaker 1`
- `"Under Section 2, and Section 2 makes this very explicit, one who innovates is responsible as a principal. Principal, innovator, it doesn't matter."-- Speaker 1`
## Chapters & Topics
1. **Solicitation of Murder and Accomplice Liability**
   > The lecture covers the topics of solicitation of murder and accomplice liability, discussing various legal cases and statutes. It emphasizes the differences between common law and statutory approaches, particularly in the context of accomplice liability. The discussion includes analysis of specific cases like State v. V.T. and State v. Weeks, exploring the elements required for accomplice liability and the interpretation of "shared purpose" in criminal acts.
   - Solicitation of murder differs from conspiracy as it does not require agreement but focuses on procurement.
   - Accomplice liability has been reformed from common law to statutory law, often making no distinction between aiding and abetting and committing the crime.
   - In State v. V.T., mere presence or knowledge of a crime is not sufficient for accomplice liability; active participation is required.
   - State v. Weeks highlights the importance of "shared purpose" in accomplice liability under New Jersey law.
   - The court discusses whether purpose can be inferred from knowledge in accomplice liability cases.
2. **Aiding and Abetting in Second-Degree Murder**
   > The lecture discusses a case where a defendant is charged with second-degree murder under an aiding and abetting theory. The court explains that aiding and abetting is not a separate crime but a different theory of liability. The elements of aiding and abetting liability under Michigan law are outlined, and the case involving Robinson and Penel is discussed. The Court of Appeals reversed the conviction, but the Michigan Supreme Court reviewed the case, considering the natural and probable consequences theory.
   - Aiding and abetting is not a separate crime but a different theory of liability.
   - Elements of aiding and abetting liability in Michigan include intending to aid, abet, counsel, or procure the commission of a crime.
   - The natural and probable consequences theory states that one can be liable for consequences within the common enterprise of the agreed-upon action.
   - Even without direct physical involvement, someone can be convicted of aiding and abetting by their presence and other supporting actions.
3. **Bailey v. Commonwealth and Innocent Instrumentality Rule**
   > The lecture discusses the Bailey v. Commonwealth case, which involves an exotic form of accomplice liability called the innocent instrumentality rule. Bailey was convicted of voluntary manslaughter, with the innocent instrumentality being a police officer. Bailey's defense on appeal included a proximate cause argument, claiming an intervening cause broke the chain of causation. The court rejected this argument as the outcome was foreseeable and exactly what Bailey intended to happen.
   - Bailey was convicted of voluntary manslaughter under the innocent instrumentality rule.
   - The innocent instrumentality in this case was a police officer.
   - Bailey's proximate cause argument was rejected because the outcome was foreseeable and intended.
4. **Standifer Case and Non-Mutual Collateral Estoppel**
   > The lecture discusses the Standifer case, which involves multiple charges related to bribery transactions. Standifer's co-defendant, Niederberger, was acquitted on three counts. Standifer then moved to dismiss the charges related to those transactions. The Supreme Court considered two arguments: legislative intent regarding Section 2 and non-mutual collateral estoppel. The court rejected both arguments, emphasizing that under Section 2, one who aids and abets is as responsible as a principal, and that non-mutual collateral estoppel does not apply in this criminal case due to various factors including the government's inability to appeal in criminal cases.
   - Standifer and Niederberger were charged in relation to bribery transactions.
   - Niederberger was acquitted on three counts, leading Standifer to move for dismissal of related charges.
   - The Supreme Court rejected arguments based on legislative intent and non-mutual collateral estoppel.
   - Section 2 makes aiders and abettors as responsible as principals.
   - Non-mutual collateral estoppel was not applied due to differences between criminal and civil cases.
## Suggestions
- Careful consideration of statutory language and case law is crucial in determining accomplice liability, as mere presence or knowledge is often insufficient for conviction.
- The distinction between knowledge and purpose in criminal law is complex and can significantly impact the outcome of cases involving accomplice liability.
- Consider the implications of the natural and probable consequences theory in determining liability for accomplices in criminal cases.
- Consider how foreseeability and intent impact the application of proximate cause in criminal cases.
- Consider the implications of treating aiders and abettors the same as principals under Section 2 in criminal law.

> **AI Suggestion**
> - The core of this lesson is understanding Aiding and Abetting. It's recommended to start with analyzing case studies to grasp Aiding and Abetting through practice of identifying the elements of accomplice liability in various scenarios.
> - Core content of Aiding and Abetting: A theory of liability where someone who assists in a crime is held responsible, even if they didn't directly commit it.

## Explanations

### 1. Vicarious Liability in Criminal Law

- **Key Points**

  - Felony murder rule holds defendants responsible for deaths occurring during the commission of a felony, even if they didn't personally cause the death.

  - Accomplice liability makes individuals equally responsible for crimes committed by their co-conspirators.

  - The Pinkerton Doctrine extends liability to reasonably foreseeable crimes committed by co-conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy.

- **Explanation** 

  The class discussion revolves around the application of vicarious liability in criminal law, specifically in relation to felony murder, accomplice liability, and the Pinkerton Doctrine. The instructor uses the case of Alvarez and his co-defendants to illustrate these concepts. The case involves a drug conspiracy where some members were charged with murder after a federal agent was killed during an undercover operation. The court's application of the Pinkerton Doctrine in this case is described as an "extreme" but permissible extension of the doctrine.

- **Alvarez and Co-defendants Case** 

  > In this case, seven individuals were charged in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine. During an undercover operation, a federal agent was killed. While only two of the conspirators were directly involved in the shooting, all were charged with various degrees of murder and assault on a federal agent. 

  1. The court rejected the argument that murder was not reasonably foreseeable in a cocaine distribution conspiracy, citing comments made by Alvarez about never going back to jail and the general nexus between weapons and drug trade.

  2. The court also dismissed the argument that some conspirators played minor roles, noting that they were present at the scene of the crime.

  3. The case demonstrates the extensive reach of the Pinkerton Doctrine, holding conspirators responsible for crimes they did not personally commit but were deemed reasonably foreseeable within the scope of the conspiracy.

### 2. Reasonable Foreseeability in Conspiracy Cases

- **Key Points**

  - Courts must determine what actions or outcomes were reasonably foreseeable to co-conspirators.

  - The perspective of foreseeability should be from the co-conspirators' point of view, not based on general assumptions or case law.

  - Evidence of foreseeability can include direct statements, actions of conspirators, or expert testimony on common practices in similar criminal enterprises.

- **Explanation** 

  The class discussion critically examines how courts determine reasonable foreseeability in conspiracy cases. The instructor questions whether the government should be required to prove foreseeability as a matter of fact, rather than relying on general assumptions or case law. The discussion highlights the potential dangers of allowing juries to make inferences based on popular culture or general assumptions about criminal activities, rather than specific evidence presented in the case.

- **Proving Foreseeability in Drug Conspiracy Cases** 

  > The instructor proposes hypothetical methods for proving foreseeability in drug conspiracy cases, such as flipping a co-conspirator to testify about typical practices or using expert testimony from law enforcement. 

  1. A flipped co-conspirator could testify about the regular presence of weapons in similar transactions.

  2. A DEA expert could provide testimony based on experience with numerous similar operations, stating the frequency of firearm presence.

  3. The discussion emphasizes the importance of proving foreseeability based on factual evidence rather than relying solely on general assumptions or case law.

### 3. Pinkerton Liability in Conspiracy Law

- **Key Points**

  - Pinkerton liability is not retroactive - a person cannot be held liable for crimes committed before they joined the conspiracy.

  - Some state courts have rejected the Pinkerton Doctrine.

  - The Model Penal Code has rejected Pinkerton liability.

- **Explanation** 

  The class discussion covered Pinkerton liability in the context of conspiracy law. It was explained that if someone was not part of a conspiracy at the time a crime was committed, they cannot be held accountable under the Pinkerton theory for that crime. The instructor noted that Pinkerton liability is controversial, with some state courts and the Model Penal Code rejecting it. An extreme example of Pinkerton liability was mentioned involving Ross Ulbricht and the Silk Road crypto site, where millions of dollars of drug transactions were arranged.

- **Case of Thomas Mahoney** 

  > In the discussion, a hypothetical case involving Thomas Mahoney was mentioned. Mahoney joined a conspiracy after a murder had already been committed. 

  1. It was concluded that Mahoney could not be charged with second-degree murder under Pinkerton liability because he was not part of the conspiracy when the murder occurred.

  2. This example illustrates the non-retroactive nature of Pinkerton liability.

### 4. Single vs. Multiple Conspiracies - Bruno and Iacono Case

- **Key Points**

  - The case involved Bruno, Iacono, and 84 others charged with a single narcotics conspiracy.

  - The defendants argued that the evidence proved separate conspiracies rather than a single one.

  - The conspiracy involved different roles: smugglers, middlemen, and retailers in different locations.

  - There was no clear evidence of direct communication between all parts of the alleged conspiracy.

- **Explanation** 

  The case of Bruno and Iacono was discussed in class to illustrate the complexities of proving a single large conspiracy versus multiple smaller ones. The evidence showed a conspiracy existing over a substantial period with various roles including smugglers, middlemen, and retailers in different locations (New York, Texas, Louisiana). The defendants argued that this proved separate conspiracies rather than a single one. The court's reasoning suggested that even without direct communication between all parts, knowledge of the other parts' existence could be assumed due to the nature of the drug trade. This case highlights the concept of "assumed agreement" in drug conspiracy cases.

- **Bruno's and Iacono's Individual Cases** 

  > The court's handling of Bruno's and Iacono's individual insufficiency arguments was discussed. 

  1. For Bruno, the court dismissed his insufficiency argument, stating he was "plainly guilty".

  2. For Iacono, the court found the case was close. Iacono had received money orders in assumed names totaling $6,800. The court suggested he was probably guilty of something but couldn't tie it directly to the narcotics conspiracy.

### 5. Kotteakos v. United States - Hub and Spoke Conspiracy

- **Key Points**

  - The case involved fraudulent loan applications to a federal agency.

  - Simon Brown acted as a broker (the hub) for multiple groups of fraudulent applicants (the spokes).

  - The different groups of applicants were unaware of each other's existence.

  - The Supreme Court used the analogy of a wheel without a rim to describe this type of conspiracy.

- **Explanation** 

  In Kotteakos v. United States, the conspiracy involved Simon Brown acting as a broker for multiple groups submitting fraudulent loan applications. The court used the metaphor of a wheel with Brown as the hub and the different groups as spokes, but without a rim connecting the spokes. This case is significant because it demonstrates the importance of proving interdependence in conspiracy cases. The Supreme Court disagreed with the lower court's harmless error ruling, emphasizing the prejudicial effect of trying multiple conspiracies as one large conspiracy. The court noted the risk of "transference of guilt" from one defendant to another in such cases.

- **Comparison with Bruno Case** 

  > The class discussed how Kotteakos differs from the Bruno case in terms of conspiracy structure. 

  1. In Bruno, even if the spokes didn't know about other spokes specifically, they knew there had to be other parts of the operation due to the nature of drug trafficking.

  2. In Kotteakos, there was no necessary knowledge or interdependence between the different groups working with Brown.

  3. This distinction highlights the difference between a "wheel with a rim" (Bruno) and a "wheel without a rim" (Kotteakos) in conspiracy cases.

### 6. United States v. Schweiss - Hobbs Act Violation and Undercover Operations

- **Key Points**

  - Schweiss and DiDino were charged with conspiracy to violate the Hobbs Act.

  - The case involved paying a "street tax" to an organized crime group in Chicago called the Outfit.

  - LaVette, a business owner, cooperated with the FBI and recorded meetings with the defendants.

- **Explanation** 

  The case of United States v. Schweiss was discussed in class as an example of a Hobbs Act violation. The defendants were charged with conspiracy to violate the Hobbs Act through their involvement in an extortion scheme. The scheme involved collecting a "street tax" or "rent" from businesses, with threats of harm or property damage for non-compliance. The case highlighted the use of undercover operations, as one of the victims, LaVette, agreed to cooperate with the FBI and record meetings with the defendants. The street tax was noted to be $1,000 per month in the 1980s, which was considered a significant amount at the time.

- **LaVette's Cooperation with the FBI** 

  > LaVette, a business owner struggling to pay the street tax, agreed to work undercover for the FBI. 

  1. LaVette contacted the FBI when he couldn't afford the $1,000 monthly street tax.

  2. He agreed to work undercover and record meetings with the Outfit representatives.

  3. This cooperation led to evidence against Schweiss and DiDino.

### 7. Withdrawal from a Conspiracy

- **Key Points**

  - A defendant must show some evidence from which the jury could find withdrawal to get a withdrawal instruction.

  - If the defendant offers some evidence of withdrawal, the prosecutor must prove the absence of withdrawal beyond a reasonable doubt.

  - Withdrawal requires an affirmative action, not simply stopping participation.

  - The prosecutor has to disprove withdrawal beyond a reasonable doubt, which is equivalent to proving the existence of the conspiracy at the relevant time.

- **Explanation** 

  To get a withdrawal instruction, a defendant must present some evidence that could lead a jury to find withdrawal. This evidence doesn't need to be conclusive, but it must be sufficient for consideration. Once this threshold is met, the burden shifts to the prosecutor, who must then prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not withdraw from the conspiracy. This is effectively the same as proving that the conspiracy still existed with the defendant's participation at the relevant time. The court emphasizes that withdrawal requires an affirmative action by the defendant, not just a cessation of activities related to the conspiracy.

- **Daddino's Argument for Withdrawal** 

  > In this case, Daddino argued that he had withdrawn from the conspiracy because he was fired from the criminal organization. 

  1. Daddino claimed that being fired was equivalent to withdrawal, as he was no longer part of the organization.

  2. He argued that he shouldn't have to perform an additional affirmative act to withdraw when he was already removed from the group.

  3. The Seventh Circuit rejected this argument, stating that being fired was not sufficient to constitute withdrawal.

- **The "Ticking Bomb" Metaphor** 

  > The Seventh Circuit used a metaphor of a ticking bomb to explain the concept of withdrawal from a conspiracy. 

  1. The court stated that you can't simply walk away from a ticking bomb and claim you've withdrawn.

  2. This metaphor emphasizes that mere cessation of activities is not enough to constitute withdrawal from a conspiracy.

  3. It implies that an active effort to disarm the "bomb" (i.e., stop the conspiracy) might be necessary for true withdrawal.

- **Hypothetical Scenario: Moving to Florida** 

  > A hypothetical scenario was discussed where Daddino might move to Florida, specifically Sarasota on the Gulf of Mexico coast, and never return or communicate with his former associates. 

  1. Moving to Florida could potentially be considered an affirmative act towards withdrawal.

  2. The court suggests that such a move might be recognized as a "more big-hearted type of withdrawal."

  3. This scenario illustrates that physical separation and cessation of communication could potentially constitute withdrawal, as it's an affirmative act that clearly shows the person is "out of there."

### 8. Extreme Forms of Withdrawal

- **Key Points**

  - Extreme withdrawal requires disavowing or defeating the purpose of the conspiracy.

  - Actions like stopping the conspiracy from operating or calling the police could constitute extreme withdrawal.

- **Explanation** 

  The court recognizes a more stringent form of withdrawal from a conspiracy, which goes beyond mere cessation of activities or physical separation. This extreme form requires the defendant to actively work against the conspiracy's goals. This could involve actions that directly impede the conspiracy's operations or bring it to the attention of law enforcement. Such actions demonstrate a clear and unequivocal break from the conspiracy and its objectives.

### 9. Hearsay Evidence in Conspiracy Cases

- **Key Points**

  - Hearsay statements made during the course of a conspiracy can be admitted as evidence under a specific exception.

  - A defendant's withdrawal from the conspiracy can affect the admissibility of these statements against them.

- **Explanation** 

  In conspiracy trials, there is a hearsay exception that allows statements made during the course of the conspiracy to be admitted as evidence. However, if a defendant has successfully withdrawn from the conspiracy, statements made after their withdrawal may not be admissible against them. In Daddino's case, he argued that certain hearsay statements should not have been admitted because he had withdrawn from the conspiracy. However, since the court found that he had not successfully withdrawn, this argument was unsuccessful.

- **Daddino's Evidentiary Argument on Appeal** 

  > Daddino argued on appeal that hearsay statements used at his trial should not have been admitted because he had withdrawn from the conspiracy. 

  1. Daddino challenged the admission of hearsay statements under the exception for statements made during the course of a conspiracy.

  2. His argument was based on his claim that he had withdrawn from the conspiracy, which would make these statements inadmissible against him.

  3. The court rejected this argument because they had already determined that Daddino had not successfully withdrawn from the conspiracy.

# Class 20 - Corporate Criminal Responsibility 
> Date & Time: 2025-03-24 18:01:33
## Theme
Corporate criminal liability extends to actions of employees, even when against company policy. Corporations must actively enforce compliance and cannot rely solely on written policies to avoid liability. The expansion of corporate criminal liability reflects the need for effective deterrence in complex organizational structures.
## Takeaways
1. Corporations can be held criminally liable for actions of their employees, even when those actions violate company policy.
2. The Supreme Court justified corporate criminal liability by drawing an analogy between corporate liability for torts and crimes.
3. Federal antitrust law includes per se violations that do not require proof of effect on competition.
4. The Bank of New England case established that a corporation's mens rea can be determined from the collective knowledge of all employees.
5. Arizona's corporate criminal liability statute requires actions by high managerial agents to be imputed to the corporation.
6. Corporations must implement and actively enforce strong compliance policies to prevent criminal liability.
7. The existence of a corporate policy alone does not affect liability for crimes committed by agents and employees under federal common law.
## Highlights
- `"If we've been holding corporations responsible for the torts of their employees, why not the crimes of their employees? It's the same social purpose. It's to prevent misconduct and to deter organizations from allowing it to happen."-- Prof Rehnquist 《Lecture on Corporate Criminal Liability》`
- `"You can't avoid corporate criminal responsibility by just having a policy. I mean, maybe you could prove that it was enforced rigorously, but that's just too much of a leak."-- Prof Rehnquist 《Lecture on Corporate Criminal Liability》`
- `"You're still liable for crimes committed by your agents and employees, okay?"-- Prof Rehnquist`
- `"It's to discourage people from using banks and the banking system to, you know, wander from illicit business, okay?"-- Prof Rehnquist`
- `"The takeaway, I think, from a public policy perspective of both Hilton and the Bank of New England is you have to do whatever you can to ensure that your organization is complying with the law, okay? You'll be responsible."-- [Prof Rehnquist]`
- `"They were well aware of the problems, and they appeared to design some kind of a workaround that sounds a little sketchy. So they definitely had, they had the authority, and they had the intent."-- [Prof Rehnquist]`
## Chapters & Topics
1. **Corporate Criminal Liability in the Elkins Act and Sherman Act Cases**
   > The lecture discusses two landmark cases related to corporate criminal liability: New York Central Railroad v. United States (Elkins Act) and United States v. Hilton Hotels Corporation (Sherman Act). Both cases establish and reinforce the principle of holding corporations criminally liable for actions of their employees, even when those actions may violate company policy. The courts emphasize public policy reasons and the need to prevent misconduct in large organizations as justifications for corporate criminal liability.
   - The Elkins Act prohibited railroads from paying rebates to sugar companies, aiming to prevent price discrimination in the regulated railroad industry.
   - New York Central Railroad argued that the Elkins Act was unconstitutional, claiming it violated due process by punishing innocent shareholders.
   - The Supreme Court rejected this argument, drawing an analogy between corporate liability for torts and crimes.
   - The Sherman Act criminalizes agreements in restraint of trade, requiring multiple parties to be involved.
   - In the Hilton Hotels case, the court extended corporate criminal liability to violations of the Sherman Act, despite the lack of specific language in the statute.
   - The court rejected Hilton's defense that the employee acted against company policy, emphasizing the importance of apparent authority and the need for companies to enforce their policies.
2. **Federal Antitrust Law and Corporate Criminal Liability**
   > The lecture discusses federal antitrust law, corporate criminal liability, and the Bank of New England case. It covers per se violations in antitrust law, the irrelevance of corporate policies in determining liability under federal common law, and the elements of the Currency and Transaction Reporting Act. The case involves a bank's failure to report cash transactions over $10,000 and the concept of aiding and abetting liability.
   - Per se violations in antitrust law do not require proof of effect on competition
   - Under federal common law, the existence of a corporate policy does not affect liability for crimes committed by agents and employees
   - The Currency and Transaction Reporting Act requires reporting cash transactions over $10,000 within 15 days
   - The Bank of New England case involves a customer, James McDonough, who was cashing checks under $10,000 to avoid reporting
   - McDonough and two tellers were also defendants in the case
   - The case explores the concept of aiding and abetting liability
3. **Bank of New England Case and Corporate Criminal Liability**
   > The Bank of New England case involved violations of currency reporting requirements. The bank was found guilty of willfully violating these requirements. The court upheld the collective knowledge instruction, allowing the bank's mens rea to be determined from the collective knowledge of all employees. The case demonstrates that corporations can be held criminally liable for the actions of their employees, even when not explicitly stated in the statute.
